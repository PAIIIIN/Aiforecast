- 2024-02: 4 earthquakes, max magnitude 4.8
- 2024-03: 29 earthquakes, max magnitude 5.1

Model Limitations:
- The model is based on historical patterns and may not account for unexpected geological changes
- Predictions are more reliable for the near future and uncertainty increases with time
- The model predicts monthly aggregates, not individual earthquake events
- Spatial information is not fully utilized in the current time-series approach
- The model does not incorporate geological or tectonic information that might improve predictions

Recommendations for Improvement:
- Incorporate spatial clustering and fault line information
- Include additional data sources such as ground deformation, seismic wave velocity changes, etc.
- Experiment with deep learning approaches for sequence modeling
- Develop ensemble models combining multiple forecasting approaches
- Implement probabilistic forecasting to better quantify uncertainty
