Earthquake Data Visualization Summary
===================================

Generated on: 2025-04-06 07:33:30

Dataset: 1639 earthquakes within 500km of Almaty
Time range: 1970-06-05 to 2024-01-30
Magnitude range: 3.0 to 7.3
Depth range: 0.0 to 104.6 km

Visualizations Created:
1. earthquake_time_series.png - Time series of all earthquakes with magnitude and depth
2. magnitude_distribution.png - Distribution of earthquake magnitudes
3. depth_distribution.png - Distribution of earthquake depths
4. spatial_distribution.png - Map showing earthquake locations around Almaty
5. yearly_earthquake_counts.png - Number of earthquakes per year
6. monthly_earthquake_patterns.png - Number of earthquakes by month
7. depth_magnitude_correlation.png - Relationship between depth and magnitude
8. magnitude_distance.png - Earthquake magnitudes vs distance from Almaty
9. rolling_average_magnitude.png - 30-event rolling average of magnitudes
10. year_month_heatmap.png - Heatmap of earthquake frequency by year and month

Key Observations:
- Most earthquakes in the region are in the 3.0-5.0 magnitude range
- The largest recorded earthquake in the dataset had a magnitude of 7.3
- Most earthquakes occur at relatively shallow depths (10-30 km)
- There are several high-magnitude events within 200km of Almaty
- There appears to be some seasonal variation in earthquake frequency
- More recent years generally show higher counts, likely due to improved detection capabilities
