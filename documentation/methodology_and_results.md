## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the methodology and results of the Earthquake Forecasting Project for the Almaty region. The project aims to develop a forecasting system that can predict the occurrence and magnitude of earthquakes in the Almaty region of Kazakhstan.

Almaty is located in a seismically active region, and accurate earthquake forecasting can help in disaster preparedness and risk mitigation. This project leverages historical earthquake data to build machine learning models that can predict both the number of earthquakes and their maximum magnitudes on a monthly basis.

## Data Collection and Analysis

### Data Sources

The project utilized two primary datasets:
1. **Recent earthquakes dataset**: Contains 520 records from 1970 to 2024
2. **Historical earthquakes dataset**: Contains 613,787 records from 2000 to 2023

### Initial Data Analysis

Initial analysis of the datasets revealed:
- Only 4 records specifically mentioning "Almaty" in each dataset
- 96 entries related to Almaty/Kazakhstan in the recent dataset
- 203 entries related to Almaty/Kazakhstan in the historical dataset

The data includes comprehensive information about each earthquake, including:
- Time of occurrence
- Latitude and longitude
- Depth
- Magnitude and magnitude type
- Location description
- Various technical parameters (gap, dmin, rms, etc.)

### Almaty Region Definition

For this project, we defined the "Almaty region" as the area within a 500km radius of Almaty city (coordinates: 43.10°N, 76.87°E). This definition allowed us to include a sufficient number of earthquakes for meaningful analysis while maintaining relevance to the Almaty area.

## Data Preprocessing

### Expanding the Dataset

To overcome the limited number of direct Almaty records, we:
1. Calculated the distance from Almaty for each earthquake using the Haversine formula
2. Filtered earthquakes within 500km of Almaty
3. This expanded our dataset from just 4 direct Almaty records to 1,639 records

### Handling Missing Values

The preprocessing pipeline included:
- Filling missing depth values with the median depth
- Removing records with missing magnitude values (critical for forecasting)
- Converting time to datetime format

### Feature Engineering

We created several time-based features to capture temporal patterns:
- Year, month, day
- Day of year, week of year
- Distance from Almaty (in kilometers)

### Data Integration

We merged the recent and historical datasets, ensuring no duplicates by:
- Adding a source column to track the origin of each record
- Removing duplicates based on time, latitude, longitude, and magnitude
- Sorting by time for chronological analysis

The final processed dataset includes earthquakes from 1970 to 2024, with magnitudes ranging from 3.0 to 7.3 and depths from 0.0 to 104.6 km.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis to understand patterns in the earthquake data. This included:

### Temporal Analysis

- **Time Series Analysis**: Visualized earthquakes over time, revealing periods of higher and lower activity
- **Yearly Patterns**: Analyzed the number of earthquakes per year, showing an increase in recorded events in recent years (likely due to improved detection capabilities)
- **Monthly Patterns**: Identified potential seasonal variations in earthquake frequency
- **Year-Month Heatmap**: Created a heatmap showing earthquake frequency by year and month to identify temporal clusters

### Spatial Analysis

- **Spatial Distribution**: Mapped earthquake locations around Almaty, revealing several distinct seismic zones
- **Distance Analysis**: Analyzed earthquake magnitudes relative to distance from Almaty, identifying high-magnitude events within 200km of the city

### Magnitude and Depth Analysis

- **Magnitude Distribution**: Most earthquakes in the region are in the 3.0-5.0 magnitude range, with the largest at 7.3
- **Depth Distribution**: Most earthquakes occur at relatively shallow depths (10-30 km)
- **Depth-Magnitude Correlation**: Explored the relationship between depth and magnitude, finding no strong linear correlation

### Rolling Statistics

- **Rolling Average Magnitude**: Calculated 30-event rolling average of earthquake magnitudes to identify trends
- **Magnitude-Distance Relationship**: Analyzed how earthquake magnitudes vary with distance from Almaty

These visualizations provided valuable insights into the patterns and characteristics of earthquakes in the Almaty region, which informed our modeling approach.

## Model Development

### Feature Selection

For the forecasting models, we created monthly aggregations of the earthquake data and derived the following features:
- **Lagged Features**: Previous 1, 3, and 6 months' earthquake counts and magnitudes
- **Rolling Statistics**: 3-month and 6-month rolling averages of counts and magnitudes
- **Cyclical Features**: Month encoded as sine and cosine components to capture seasonality

### Model Architecture

We developed two separate models:
1. **Earthquake Count Model**: Predicts the number of earthquakes per month
   - Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor
   - Parameters: 100 estimators, max depth of 5

2. **Earthquake Magnitude Model**: Predicts the maximum magnitude per month
   - Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor
   - Parameters: 100 estimators, max depth of 5

### Training Methodology

- Data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets chronologically
- Features were standardized using StandardScaler
- Models were trained on the training set and evaluated on both training and testing sets

## Model Evaluation

### Evaluation Metrics

We evaluated the models using several metrics:

**Earthquake Count Model**:
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R² Score

**Earthquake Magnitude Model**:
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R² Score

### Prediction Methodology

For future predictions, we implemented a recursive forecasting approach:
1. Use the last known values for the first prediction
2. Use previous predictions as inputs for subsequent predictions
3. Update rolling statistics based on a mix of actual data and predictions
4. Calculate risk levels based on predicted counts and magnitudes

### Risk Assessment

We defined four risk levels based on predicted earthquake counts and magnitudes:
- **Low Risk**: 0 earthquakes or maximum magnitude < 4.0
- **Moderate Risk**: < 5 earthquakes and maximum magnitude < 5.0
- **High Risk**: < 10 earthquakes and maximum magnitude < 6.0
- **Very High Risk**: ≥ 10 earthquakes or maximum magnitude ≥ 6.0

## Forecasting Application

We developed a user-friendly Streamlit application to make the forecasting models accessible and useful.

### Application Features

- **Forecast Generation**: Ability to generate forecasts for a user-specified number of months
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic charts showing historical data and predictions
- **Risk Assessment**: Visual representation of monthly risk levels
- **Historical Data Exploration**: Tools to explore the historical earthquake data
- **Spatial Visualization**: Map showing the distribution of earthquakes around Almaty

### Technical Implementation

- **Framework**: Streamlit for the web application
- **Visualization Libraries**: Plotly for interactive charts
- **Data Storage**: CSV files for data and model parameters
- **Model Deployment**: Joblib for model serialization and loading

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### Key Findings

1. The Almaty region experiences regular seismic activity, with most earthquakes in the 3.0-5.0 magnitude range
2. There are several high-magnitude events (>5.0) within 200km of Almaty, posing significant risk
3. Most earthquakes occur at relatively shallow depths (10-30 km)
4. There appears to be some seasonal variation in earthquake frequency
5. The forecasting models can provide reasonable predictions for the near future, with accuracy decreasing over time

### Model Limitations

- The model is based on historical patterns and may not account for unexpected geological changes
- Predictions are more reliable for the near future and uncertainty increases with time
- The model predicts monthly aggregates, not individual earthquake events
- Spatial information is not fully utilized in the current time-series approach
- The model does not incorporate geological or tectonic information that might improve predictions

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Data Enhancement**:
   - Incorporate additional data sources such as ground deformation, seismic wave velocity changes
   - Include geological and tectonic information about fault lines and plate boundaries

2. **Modeling Approaches**:
   - Experiment with deep learning approaches for sequence modeling
   - Develop ensemble models combining multiple forecasting approaches
   - Implement probabilistic forecasting to better quantify uncertainty

3. **Spatial Analysis**:
   - Incorporate spatial clustering and fault line information
   - Develop grid-based forecasting for specific sub-regions

4. **Application Enhancements**:
   - Add real-time data integration
   - Implement alert systems for high-risk periods
   - Develop mobile applications for wider accessibility

### Practical Applications

The earthquake forecasting system developed in this project can be used for:
1. **Disaster Preparedness**: Planning emergency response resources during high-risk periods
2. **Risk Assessment**: Informing building codes and infrastructure planning
3. **Public Awareness**: Educating the public about earthquake risks and preparedness
4. **Research**: Contributing to the broader understanding of seismic patterns in the region

By continuing to refine and improve the forecasting models, this system can become an increasingly valuable tool for earthquake risk management in the Almaty region.
